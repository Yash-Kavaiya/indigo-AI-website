## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd vite-react-typescript-starter
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the repository. The directory name `vite-react-typescript-starter` is based on the `name` field in `package.json`)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port shown in your terminal) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`

Lints the project files using ESLint to check for code quality and potential errors.

### `npm run preview` or `yarn preview`

Serves the production build from the `dist` folder locally. This is a way to test the production build before deploying.
